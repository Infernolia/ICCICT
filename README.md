Paper Title: Big Data Analytics for Sustainable Cities: Pune Tree Census Data Exploratory Analysis

Abstract: This study aims to introduce an example of a data science pipeline integrating Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Visualization and GIS techniques for open big data in sustainable development. The chosen techniques have been implemented on the Tree Census Dataset, obtained from the geo-enabled Tree census survey conducted by the Pune Municipal Corporation, dated August 2019. This study focuses on the visualization of big data, ward-wise analysis and identification of marginalized species that require urgent attention of the authorities. The key feature of this study is the introduction of a new biodiversity index, to overcome the shortcomings of the existing indices, when applied to cities in the Indian subcontinent.
